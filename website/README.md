# Project Name: String Theory

* Description: This website is meant to educate people about the theory of Everything, more specifically, String Theory. It explains these theories in simple terms and then provides a short comedic video about string theory made by two nyuad students in celebration of the 30-minute film festival.

* Process: I created the website by first creating rough wireframes of my ideas. Then, I created a simple outline of the website using HTML. As I added the different sections of my website in HTML, I used CSS to edit and change the styles and looks of the website. I also added hover effects in the CSS file to increase user interactivity. Finally, I added animation to my subheaders using Javascript. Throughout creating this website, I often turned to google and youtube to learn how to do some of these effects like the hover and text animation.

* Reflection/Evaluation: Initially, I included in my wireframe multiple subpages, however, because I did not have enough time I had to create a simpler version of my website. However, I was initially not expecting to add as much interactivity and hover effects as I did, but as I was learning about them, I found them fun and easy so I added more. Overall, even though it does not meet my initial expectations, I am happy with the website as it is only my first one and there is so much more still to learn.
