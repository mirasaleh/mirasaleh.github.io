# Project Name: String Theory

* Description: This website is meant to educate people about the theory of Everything, more specifically, String Theory. It explains these theories in simple terms and then provides a short comedic video about string theory made by two nyuad students in celebration of the 30-minute film festival. The website has a science-related theme, with various sections such as "Theory of Everything" and "String Theory" which suggest a focus on scientific topics. Additionally, I used  colors such as blue, white, and black as they are associated with science and technology. The yellow hover effect provides a visual contrast to the other colors used on the website, which are mostly in the blue and green tones. This contrast can help draw attention to interactive elements like links and buttons when the user hovers over them, making them easier to notice. The font I used is sans-serif font, which is a popular choice for modern and minimalist designs. Sans-serif fonts are often preferred for digital media because they are easier to read on screens and have a clean and simple aesthetic.



* Process: I have implemented the concept of educating people about the theory of everything and specifically string theory by using a combination of visuals and text. The homepage contains a background video of an artistic illustration of String theory to grab the user's attention and make them interested. When the user clicks on the "String Theory" link, they are taken to a page that provides an overview of the topic, including a brief introduction to the concept and some of its basic principles. I chose to have a minimalist design to my website because a minimalist design is often associated with simplicity and clarity, which can make it easier for users to navigate the website and find the information they are looking for. By reducing visual clutter, the user's attention is focused on the main content of the website, making it easier to process. Second, a minimalist design can help to create a sense of sophistication and elegance, which may be fitting for a website dedicated to complex scientific concepts like string theory. I created the website by first creating rough wireframes of my ideas. Then, I created a simple outline of the website using HTML. As I added the different sections of my website in HTML, I used CSS to edit and change the styles and looks of the website. I also added hover effects in the CSS file to increase user interactivity. Finally, I added animation to my subheaders using Javascript. 

* Reflection/Evaluation: Initially, I included in my wireframe multiple subpages, however, because I did not have enough time I had to create a simpler version of my website. However, I was initially not expecting to add as much interactivity and hover effects as I did, but as I was learning about them, I found them fun and easy so I added more. Overall, even though it does not meet my initial expectations, I am happy with the website as it is only my first one and there is so much more still to learn.
