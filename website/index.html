        <h1 id="more">What is the Theory of Everything?</h1>
        <p>The "Theory of Everything" is a theoretical idea in physics that aims to unify all of the fundamental forces and particles in the universe into a single, comprehensive framework. This would include the unification of gravity with the three other fundamental forces (electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces) and would provide a complete and consistent description of the universe at both the microscopic and macroscopic scales.</p>

        <p>The pursuit of the Theory of Everything is motivated by the desire to understand the fundamental nature of the universe and the underlying principles that govern it. This would not only deepen our understanding of the world around us but could also have practical applications, such as developing new technologies and solving long-standing problems in physics.</p>

        <p>There have been several attempts to develop a Theory of Everything. Here is a short summary of each of these attempts: </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="theory-col">
                <h3> String Theory </h3>
                <p>String theory describes all fundamental particles and forces in the universe as tiny, one-dimensional objects called strings that vibrate at different frequencies. It also proposes the existence of additional dimensions of space beyond the familiar three dimensions of space and one of time. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-col">
                <h3> Loop Quantum Gravity</h3>
                <p>Loop Quantum Gravity is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to describe the fundamental nature of spacetime and gravity in terms of discrete, quantized units. It suggests that spacetime is made up of tiny, indivisible loops that interact with one another to give rise to the force of gravity. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-col">
                <h3> Supersymmetry </h3>
                <p>Supersymmetry proposes a fundamental symmetry between two types of particles: bosons, which carry forces, and fermions, which make up matter. According to supersymmetry, every known particle has a yet-to-be-discovered "superpartner" particle with a different spin, and these superpartners could help resolve some long-standing problems in particle physics, such as the hierarchy problem and dark matter.  </p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <p>There is currently no consensus on which theory, if any, is the most promising approach to a Theory of Everything, as each theory has its own strengths and weaknesses. String theory, loop quantum gravity, and supersymmetry are among the leading candidates, and each has its own unique approach to the problem of unifying all the fundamental forces and particles in the universe. However, the pursuit of a Theory of Everything remains an open and active area of research, and it is possible that a new, unexpected breakthrough could ultimately provide the key to solving this longstanding problem in physics. </p>

            <p>In celebration of the <strong> 30 minute film festival </strong>, two Computer Science students decided to film a short movie where they prove string theory. But as it turns out, their proof was just another type of string - spaghetti code! Good thing they are not physics majors!</p>
